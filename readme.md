currently done part 1 : 10.1-10.2
               part 2 : 10.3-10.10
               part 3 : 10.11-10.16   (10.13 material has a typo)
               part 4 : 10.17-10.24, 10.26-10.27
               
lesson from 10.19: Always check the schema. Always check api logs.

lesson from 10.23&24: useRepositories hook can take null parameters. So there is no need to use seperate queries/hooks(ends up with errors).

10.25 needs more work
10.24 needs to debounce. 10.27 needs refetch.
