currently done part 1 : 10.1-10.2
               part 2 : 10.3-10.10
               part 3 : 10.11-10.16   (10.13 material has a typo)
               part 4 : 10.17-10.22
               
  lesson from 10.19: Always check the schema. Always check api logs.

currently stuck at 10.23 and 24. The problem is the useRepositories hook. 
I can pass parameters to it, but in another place where I use the hook with no parameters it reports errors.
had to review graphQL , read docs.
