about the problem I encountered in 10.19(files in the other branch):

My useRepositories hook works as usual, fetching all repository items I need. But my useSingleRepository hook that calls useQuery to fetch a single repo returns a "true" for loading all the time, and the data is undefined.At the same time, useRepositories hook is affected and returns a "true" for loading, too.

I googled this problem and people suggest using "no-cache " fetch policy. It does not work for me.
below is my console log showing the status of two loading variables:

all repo is loading? true
all repo is loading? true
all repo is loading? false //after this line, I called the function fetching singleRepo.

all repo is loading? true
the one from old repositories :undefined
single repo is loading? true
all repo is loading? true
the one from old repositories: undefined
single repo is loading? true
